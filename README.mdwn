Simplec makes your libvirt managed VMs available via local DNS. It writes a
hosts file that can then be parsed by dnsmasq (a lightweight DHCP and caching
DNS server) so that you can query name and addresses of your VMs easily.

It also prints the vm names and IPs to stdout for easy c'n'p.

To build and run do a:

    make && make && ./simplec

If you want to install it as a systemd user service for the current user use:

	make install_user

and to get rid of it again use:

	make uninstall_user
