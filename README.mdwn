Simplec makes your libvirt managed VMs available via local DNS. It writes a
hosts file that can then be parsed by dnsmasq (a lightweight DHCP and caching
DNS server) so that you can query name and addresses of your VMs easily.

It also prints the vm names and IPs to stdout for easy c'n'p.

To build and run do a:

    make && make && ./simplec
